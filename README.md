A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Currently you can add new drawing by pressing a button and set custom name. By selecting any one of the items from the list, the canvas opens. Other parts of the assignment are still under constrction and l will hopeful soon be uploaded too.

This is my first go at Flutter.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
